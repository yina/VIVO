# NYU development VIVO version

This fork is a feature version. It contains the two primary development features:

* developing VIVO to return people only.
* applying multiple ranking algorithms to return people.

Yin Aphinyanaphongs and Lawrence Fu with the Center for Health Informatics and Bioinformatics at New York University maintain this fork.

# VIVO: Connect, Share, Discover

VIVO is an open source semantic web application originally developed and implemented at Cornell. 
When installed and populated with researcher interests, activities, and accomplishments, 
it enables the discovery of research and scholarship across disciplines at that institution and beyond. 

VIVO supports browsing and a search function which returns faceted results for rapid retrieval 
of desired information. Content in any local VIVO installation may be maintained manually, 
brought into VIVO in automated ways from local systems of record 
(such as HR, grants, course, and faculty activity databases), 
or from database providers (such as publication aggregators and funding agencies).
